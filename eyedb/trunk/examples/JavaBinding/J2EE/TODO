	- deleteperson.jsp: delete view [DONE]
	
- add servlets to:
	- create a person [DONE]
	- edit a person [DONE]

- fix JSP tag lib dependency problem [DONE] (classpath variable)

- idem for person: jsp and servlet for car [DONE]

- change bean to separate bean.persons (getPersons() returning a Collection)
 from bean.person[oid] (bean.getPerson() returning a Map) [DONE]

- add collection support
	- problem: how to get collection as a property of an object, as generated Java code does not respect standard interfaces
	-> class GoodPerson extends Person {
		Set<Car> getCars(): creates a Set using API
		void setCars( Set<Car> cars): set the collection
		}
	- hack EyeDBBean.getObject() to return a GoodPerson if loaded object instanceof Person
	- JSP to modify: createperson, editperson, viewperson
