- add collection support
	- problem: how to get collection as a property of an object, as generated Java code does not respect standard interfaces
	-> class GoodPerson extends Person {
		Set<Car> getCars(): creates a Set using API
		void setCars( Set<Car> cars): set the collection
		}
	- hack EyeDBBean.getObject() to return a GoodPerson if loaded object instanceof Person
	- JSP to modify: createperson, editperson, viewperson
