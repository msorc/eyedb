HOWTO Release EyeDB


This mini-howto explains how to make a release of EyeDB.


1) Creating the tarballs and checking the distribution

1-1) Creating the tarballs

Creating the tarballs is done simply by:
'make dist'

This will create 2 tarballs, eyedb-RELEASE.tar.bz2 and
eyedb-RELEASE.tar.gz (where RELEASE is replaced by the current release
number, for instance 2.8.8).


1-2) Checking the distribution

This is done by:
'make mydistcheck'

Standard automake 'make distcheck' cannot work for EyeDB, which
requires being installed first.

Running 'make mydistcheck' will:
- create the tarballs
- untar a tarball in a new, empty directory
- run 'configure', 'make', 'make install' in this directory
- run 'eyedb-post-install.sh'
- run 'make check' to run the test suites on the distribution


2) Uploading the tarballs to sourceforge

Once created and checked, uploading the tarballs is done by:
- logging in to sourceforge
- go to EyeDB project page
- go to the File Manager (under Project Admin menu)
- create a folder for the new release (use the 'gear' menu)
- upload the tarballs in this folder (use the 'gear' menu)

That's all, the project news will be updated automatically.


3) Posting to eyedb-general

Once the release done, it is convenient to send a mail to
eyedb-general@lists.sourceforge.net to announce the new release.
