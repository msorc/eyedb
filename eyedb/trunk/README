Introduction
------------

EyeDB is an Object Database Management System.

It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public. Refer to file
COPYING to get the license.


Compiling EyeDB
---------------

In order to compile EyeDB, you need the following tools: 
GNU make
C++ compiler
bison
flex

To build the Java part, you need a java compiler (gcj or javac from Sun's JDK)
and an archive tool to build a .jar archive.

If you want to build documentation, you will need the following additional tools:
latex, dvips, ps2pdf (for manual)
doxygen (for api documentation)
xsltproc (for manpages)

If you have latex2html installed, the HTML version of the manual will be generated.

Please refer to your distribution to check if these tools are packaged for your distribution (which is very likely the case) and to get their respective installation instructions.

To compile EyeDB, just run:
./configure
make

configure script takes the following useful options:
--prefix=PREFIX           to specify EyeDB installation root directory (default is /usr)
--enable-debug            to compile with debug (default is no)
--enable-optimize=flag    to compile with given optimization flag, for instance --enable-optimize=-O2 (default is no optimization)
--enable-swig             to generate various languages bindings with SWIG (default is no)

Full description of configure options can be obtained with:
./configure --help

Examples and tests programs, located in sub-directories examples/ and tests/, are not compiled by 'make' 
or 'make all' but by 'make check'.


Installing EyeDB
----------------

After compiling EyeDB, you can install it with the usual:
make install

This will install EyeDB in the directories that you have given
when running the configure script.

After installing EyeDB, you need to run the post-install script, as:
PREFIX/share/eyedb/tools/eyedb-postinstall.sh 

For instance, if you have installed EyeDB in /usr/local (by running 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local), the post-install script is:
/usr/local/share/eyedb/tools/eyedb-postinstall.sh 

NOTE: running the post-install script is mandatory, otherwise your
installation will not work.


Running EyeDB
-------------

To run EyeDB, you need first to start the server by:
eyedbrc start

You can then check that the server is running by:
eyedbrc status

To check that EyeDB runs, after starting the server, you can run the 
following command:
eyedboql -U eyedbroot -P eyedbroot -c "select schema" --print
This should print a number of EyeDB base structures.

You can then try some examples, such as examples/GettingStarted, that 
shows how to create a database using a schema, insert objects, build
OQL queries (OQL is the Object Query Language) and use the C++ and Java
programming interfaces.


Finding documentation
---------------------

You can find EyeDB documentation in the following places, in the source 
tree after compilation:
- doc/eyedb-VERSION/manual: the different manuals
- doc/eyedb-VERSION/api: the C++ API documentation build using doxygen
- doc/eyedb-VERSION/examples: EyeDB programming examples using the C++
and the Java APIs
