Introduction
------------

EyeDB is an Object Database Management System.

It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public. Refer to file
COPYING to get the license.


Compiling EyeDB
---------------

In order to compile EyeDB, you need the following tools: 
GNU make
C++ compiler
bison
flex

If you want to build the Java part, you need a java compiler (currently, EyeDB
has been tested with Sun's JDK, but gcj should work as well).

If you want to build documentation, you will need the following additional tools:
latex, dvips, ps2pdf (for manual)
doxygen (for api documentation)
xsltproc (for manpages)

Please refer to your distribution to check if these tools are packaged for your distribution (which is very likely the case) and to get their respective installation instructions.

To compile EyeDB, just run:
./configure
make

configure script takes the following useful options:
--prefix=PREFIX           to specify EyeDB installation root directory (default is /usr)
--enable-debug            to compile with debug (default is no)
--enable-optimize=flag    to compile with given optimization flag, for instance --enable-optimize=-O2 (default is no optimization)
--enable-java             to compile java part (default is no). If yes, you need a Java compiler
--enable-swig             to generate various languages bindings with SWIG (default is no)
--with-javac=JAVAC        to specify java javac compiler path
--with-jar=JAR            to specify java jar path

Full description of configure options can be obtained with:
./configure --help

Note that doc and examples are not build from the top-level directory:
- to build the documentation, you need to cd to the doc/ directory and run make:
cd doc
make
- to build the examples, you need to cd to the examples/ directory and run make: 
cd examples
make



Installing EyeDB
----------------

After compiling EyeDB, you can install it with the usual:
make install

This will install EyeDB under the root directory that you have given
when running the configure script (--prefix=PREFIX option).

After installing EyeDB, you need to run the post-install script, as:
PREFIX/share/eyedb/tools/eyedb-postinstall.sh 

For instance, if you have installed EyeDB in /usr/local (by running 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local), the post-install script is:
/usr/local/share/eyedb/tools/eyedb-postinstall.sh 

NOTE: running the post-install script is mandatory, otherwise your
installation will not work.


Running EyeDB
-------------

Before running EyeDB tools, you need to source the eyedbenv.sh located in 
PREFIX/etc/profile.d/eyedbenv.sh
by:
. PREFIX/etc/profile.d/eyedbenv.sh
On most systems, this will be done automatically when starting a shell.


To run EyeDB, you need first to start the server by:
eyedbrc start

You can then check that the server is running by:
eyedbrc status

To check that EyeDB runs, after starting the server, you can run the 
following command:
eyedboql -U eyedbroot -P eyedbroot -c "select schema" --print

This should print a number of EyeDB base structures.


Finding documentation
---------------------

You can find EyeDB documentation in the following places, in the source 
tree after compilation:
- doc/eyedb-VERSION/manual: the different manuals
- doc/eyedb-VERSION/api: the API documentation build using doxygen
- doc/eyedb-VERSION/examples: EyeDB programming examples (you can build 
the examples by cd'ing to this directory and run make)
