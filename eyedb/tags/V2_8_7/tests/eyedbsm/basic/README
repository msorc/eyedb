1. Creating a test database

sh dbcreate.sh foo

it echoes something like:
DB=DATABASE_FULL_PATH
-> copy and paste this line and execute it in your shell

2. Creating an hash index
./hcreate $DB hoid

hoid is the file where the oid is stored (binary form) for future uses

3. Inserting elements in the index
to insert 100 (pseudo) random data in this index:
./hinsert $DB hoid 100

4. Reading the index

to read the index:
./hread $DB hoid

and to display elements:
./hread -verbose $DB hoid
