1) Adding a new topic

bash scripts/newtopic TOPIC

This will create the following files and directories:
src/TOPIC
src/TOPIC/ChangeLog
src/TOPIC/Makefile.am

The src/TOPIC/Makefile.am is copied from scripts/newtopic/template/Makefile.am

The 'newtopic' script updates the following files:
ChangeLog
configure.in
src/Makefile.am


2) Updating the topic directory

Edit src/TOPIC/Makefile.am to add:
- the list of binaries to build
- for each list of binaries, the list of C++ sources
- the list of Java files
- the ODL file (currently only one file allowed)
- the scripts

The generated Makefile.am contains rules to create shell scripts. To create
a shell script:
- create a SCRIPTNAME.sh.in file
- add SCRIPTNAME to TOPIC_SCRIPT_FILES

The SCRIPTNAME.sh.in file can contain variables like:
EYEDB_BINDIR=@EYEDB_BINDIR@
$EYEDB_BINDIR/eyedbdbcreate foo

The following @@ variables will be automatically substituted when running make:
@EYEDB_BINDIR@
@EYEDB_LIBDIR@
@EYEDB_JAR@
@JAVA@


3) Generating the Makefiles

In top directory, run:
./autogen.sh
./configure

The configure script uses pkg-config for EyeDB compilation flags and libraries.
The EyeDB pkg-config configuration file is looked for automatically in 
known places and in most cases, nothing special is required.
If configure cannot find this configuration file and exit with an error message, 
you must pass PKG_CONFIG_PATH to configure, for instance with:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/projects/my_special_eyedb_install/lib/pkgconfig ./configure 

configure supports also standard definitions, for instance:
./configure CXX=gcc-4.1 JAVAC=$HOME/java/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/javac 

The Java compiler and virtual machines are guessed by configure; javac is 
tried before gcj.


4) Compile

Compile with:
make

at toplevel directory or in topic subdirectory
