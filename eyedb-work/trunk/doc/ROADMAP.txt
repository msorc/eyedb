 + online backup
 + any easy raw data reliability improvements
- eyedb level :
 + dump/restore off and online
 + any easy eyedb data reliability improvements

ODL Plugins
- plugin system:
 + specifications: is this plugin system is limited for code generation
   or any schema operation ?
   If it use for 
 + API (abstract class Plugin)
 + eyedbodl --plugin-name=c++-std [--plugin-file=....so]
   [--plugin-args=...]

- toolkit for writing plugins (API)
- write a c++-std binding:
 + based on the plugin system
 + based on the STL
 + using smart pointers
 + enrich the eyedb API to facilitate the write of plugins and to make the
   generated code lighter

Data reliability 2nd step

Miscelleanous
- (*) Some part of the current client code (for instance collection
  implementation) must be moved to the server part to facilitate the write
  of binding plugins, for instance the current Java binding.
