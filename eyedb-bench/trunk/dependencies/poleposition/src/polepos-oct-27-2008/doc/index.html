		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			PolePosition is a benchmark test suite to compare database engines and 
			object-relational mapping technology. As of today it is by no means complete. 
			Database vendors and open source database project participants are invited to 
			improve the test implementations and to contribute further disciplines 
			("Circuits"). The PolePosition framework source code will help to implement own 
			tests quickly and to time and output the results as number series and graphic 
			visualisations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The authors of the current test implementations do not see themselves as 
			experts for SQL, JDO or Hibernate or for any of the database engines used. If 
			you think that you can provide a faster implementation for a circuit, please 
			supply it to the PolePosition project instead of criticising the authors for 
			ignorance or the test for lacking objectivity.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a community project. It is for you! Please think positive, help us and 
			be nice to us for starting the initiative. If you have a strong ego, good! 
			Please write a better Circuit, Team, Car or Driver than we did instead of 
			laughing about us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Objectivity must be the most important goal of the benchmark tests. The results 
			show very clearly that there can not be one single "best product". Depending on 
			your application, some circuit results may be very important for you and some 
			may be completely irrelevant. If you consider basing your choice of database on 
			this benchmark, bring along lots of time to look at what every test does. You 
			will not be able to judge the results without looking at the source code that 
			produces them.
		</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			Sample results from one of our runs of the PolePosition benchmark with all the 
			included database engines are available in HTML format <a href="results/html/index.html">
				here</a>. You can also view or download the results as <a href="results/PolePosition.pdf">
				one big PDF file</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are invited and encouraged to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134549">
				download</a> the test suite and to run the tests yourself with your 
			favourite database. To use PolePosition with different JDBC databases you only 
			have to enter JDBC connection parameters into a settings property file. Test 
			cases are also provided for JDO so you can quickly get the tests running 
			against your favourite JDO implementation.

		<h2>Interpretation</h2>
		<p>
			As already expressed above, there is no best product. The importance of 
			individual results will depend on the respective application. However we think 
			that we can draw some general conclusions from the results that may be valid 
			for everyone. Because we have spent days and weeks looking at code and graphs, 
			we think that we should point out some of our findings, that you may not see 
			immediately, if you get lost in the multitude of graphics that are provided. 
			Here are some thoughts:
			<ul>
				<li>
				HSQLDB looks very good on many graphs, because much processing is done in 
				memory. We did not dig deep enough into HSQLDB source code, to understand if 
				the behaviour is fully compliant with ACID principles, since ACID transactions 
				would imply slow sync calls that make sure all data is flushed down to the hard 
				disc. Before you consider to use HSQLDB for a complex database application, you 
				should take a close look at Barcelona:query. The query optimizer does not seem 
				to cope with a query over five tables.
				<li>
				The use of O-R mapping technology like Hibernate or JDO O-R mappers has a 
				strong negative impact on performance. If you can't compensate by throwing 
				hardware at your app, you may have to avoid O-R mappers, if performance is 
				important to you. Protagonists of O-R mapping technology may tell you that 
				caching will bring you back performance. Although this may be true, do not 
				forget: Data that comes from a cache can always be stale in a multi-user 
				application. If you want your data to be up-to-date, you have to reread from 
				the database and an old cache that you can not use will even degrade 
				performance.
				<li>
				As would be expected, object databases like db4o provide best performance for 
				deep inheritance hierarchies and tree structures.
				<li>
				If you need a relational database for whatever reason, MySQL should certainly 
				be on your evaluation list. We did test quite a few other proprietary products 
				with the benchmark suite, products that may not be listed here because of their 
				license agreements. These other products did not look good at all. No wonder 
				MySQL has such a big and growing installed base.
				<li>
					If you take a look at the sources of the tests, they are also a measurement, 
					how easy it is to work against a specific database. SQL looks like a foreigner 
					in Java code, very ugly, difficult to write and refactor. O-R mappers and 
					object databases make life so much easier and productive. The task of storing 
					objects is very similar among all the products tested. If a strong mainstream 
					standard for object oriented querying can be reached, SQL will lose ground. 
					This will happen for sure, the question is, how long it will take.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Download</h2>
		<p>
			All sources of the PolePosition test suite including a couple of open source 
			database engines to run tests are available for download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134549">
				here</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Running the tests</h2>
		<p>
			We recommend you to use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> IDE 
			to&nbsp;work with the test source code. The distribution contains a .project 
			file for Eclipse to get you started quickly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The full test suite takes at least four hours to run on a fast machine. You may 
			like to take a look at the configuration possibilities first, so you can run 
			fewer tests with your favourite engines.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main class to start the PolePosition suite is org.polepos.RunSeason. At the 
			beginning of the file a static String is set with the path to the circuits 
			property file. If you change this variable to the uncommented debug version 
			supplied there also, you can check out all the database engine settings on your 
			machine first, running with few (insignificant) objects, before you wait for 
			hours to find the last test to fail.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the most important files, that you will find on your machine after you 
			download and unzip the distribution:
			<ul>
				<li>
					/settings/Jdbc.properties<br>
					configures the JDBC databases and connection parameters that are to be used.<BR>
					You can add further JDBC connections in this file.<BR>
				<li>
					/settings/Jdo.properties<BR>
					configures the JDO databases and connection parameters that are to be used.<BR>
				<li>
					/settings/Circuits.properties<BR>
					configures the settings for all circuits<BR>
				<li>
					/results/<BR>
					is where the results of your test run will end up<BR>
				<li>
					/build.xml<BR>
					is a simple Ant script to help you compile and run the tests, if you prefer 
					that to running from within Eclipse.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Source Code</h2>
		<p>
			Hopefully the source code has turned out readable enough to understand it. What 
			you may want to look for:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Circuit<br>
				a set of timed test cases that work against the same data
				<li>
					Lap<br>
				a single (timed) test
				<li>
					Team<br>
				a specific database category or engine that requires specific source code
				<li>
					Car<br>
				a specialized implementation of a team
				<li>
					Driver<br>
				an implementation of a circuit for a team
				<li>
					Since JDO and Hibernate modify classes at compile/run-time, they need their own 
					set of classes for the tests. Accordingly we did not consider it a good idea to 
					pass a set of objects from the outside into the write methods. Instead we give 
					all implementations full freedom, to do all the work on their own. By 
					collecting checksums for every timed task, the benchmark test makes sure that 
					no implementation cheats by accident.
				</li>
			</ul>
