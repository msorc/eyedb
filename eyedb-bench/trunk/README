Compiling
---------

Run:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make

configure script takes the following options:
  --enable-cpp            enable C++ code compilation default=yes
  --enable-debug          compile with debug default=no
  --enable-profile        compile with profile default=no
  --enable-java           enable java code compilation default=yes
  --enable-eyedb          enable EyeDB code compilation default=yes
  --enable-db4o           enable db4o code compilation default=yes
  --enable-hibernate      enable hibernate code compilation default=yes
  --enable-polepos        enable polepos code compilation default=yes

configure script can be passed the following variables:
  EYEDB_INSTALLDIR        EyeDB installation directory
  DB4O_JAR                DB4O jar file
  HIBERNATE_JAR           Hibernate jar file
  JDBC_CONNECTOR_JAR      JDBC connector jar file
  SLF4J_CONNECTOR_JAR     SLF4J jar file
  LOG4J_DIR               Log4Java jar directory
  HIBERNATE_LIBDIR        Hibernate libraries directory
  POLEPOS_DIR             Poleposition benchmarks source directory
  OPENOFFICEJAVA_DIR      OpenOffice java directory

Using these variables is most of the time not necessary:
- the configure script looks for EyeDB installation directory in standard places
(currently /usr $HOME/projects/eyedb/install $HOME/eyedb-install $HOME/eyedb_install)
- db4o and Hibernate binary distributions are included in the source tree and used
by default


Running
-------

The run/ sub-directory contains the configuration files, property files... that are
needed to run a bench, and a script that runs the bench itself, usually named runit.sh.

These scripts are configured by the configure script.

Running a bench is done by running the command:
make bench
in the directory associated with the bench (for instance run/quicktour/java/eyedb for
the EyeDB Java implementation of the quicktour benchmark).

The scripts take care of all the house-keeping needed to run the bench (starting server, 
creating databases...).


Bench reporting
---------------

Bench results are reported:
- on standard output
- in a CSV file, the name of the file being given in the properties file of the bench.
